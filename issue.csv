c) Beta Sensitivity
Deposit decay assumption is considered key model input that have significant impacts on the ALM model outputs. During the validation, MRM noted that currently there is no back-testing in place to monitor Decay Assumption Accuracy. The assumed values should be compared to observed values at least on a bi-annual basis at model segment level to track the accuracy and appropriateness of these assumptions.
2)	Net Interest Income was back-tested only at aggregate level.
Back-testing is part of the on-going monitoring process, which is the comparison of model forecast output to corresponding actual outcomes. Based on the objectives of NII forecasting, the comparison typically includes an assessment of the accuracy of NII forecasts against NII actuals and an explanation of NII variances over a given threshold. The model user only conducts NII back-testing at an aggregate level and not broken down to perform attribution analysis to understand the main source of variances.",,High,5/31/2021,5/31/2021,Completed,Completed,N/A,"It is recommended that the model owner perform back-testing on all key model assumptions to monitor their accuracy and make necessary updates based on the testing results. 
MRM also recommends that the model owner/model owner perform NII back-testing at model segment level.  In addition, to understand the main cause of the variances and to be consistent with industry practice, the model owner should consider designing an attribution analysis to break down the NII variances. 
Both back-tests are recommended to be performed at least quarterly and be incorporated in the On-going Monitoring Program.",2/28/2021,
53,805,1,Model1,Owner1,MRM2,Conceptual Soundness,"Depending on the features of the account being modelled, the model owner can typically choose among the following valuation methods to calculate Economic Value of Equity (EVE):
•	Discount Curve (static method): appropriate for plain vanilla products without any embedded optionality, such as non-prepayable loans without rate caps/floors;

•	Option Adjusted Spread (OAS)/Monte Carlo (MC): appropriate for products with embedded optionality whose prices are dependent on the interest rate path (or path-dependent), such as mortgages with rate caps/floors or linked with path-dependent prepayment models;

•	Lattice Model: appropriate for products with early expiration optionality, such as cancellable swaps and callable bonds.
Per review of the model documentation and discussion with the model user, it was determined the that “static method” is currently used in EVE calculation for all instruments within BancWare. Using non-simulated forward rate and discount curve/yield for calculating EVE cannot accurately capture the impact from the embedded optionality. 
The OAS/MC approach is the more theoretically correct method to value products with embedded options, such as residential mortgages.  Using the OAS/MC approach to value mortgages and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is best practice and ubiquitous in the banking industry.
MRM did not find any analysis or evidence from the model owner to justify the selection of the static method for EVE calculation of products with embedded options, such as residential mortgages or any loans or investments with call features or embedded caps or floors. 
",,High,5/31/2021,5/31/2021,Completed,Completed,N/A,"The Raymond James solution that Ameris uses does not offer the option to choose valuation methods other than the Static Pricing Method. This limitation again supports the overall recommendation to move to an in-house BancWare model.  It is recommended that the model owner reconsider the EVE methodology being used to better evaluate financial instruments on the balance sheet that have embedded options assuming that the Bancware model is run in-house in the near future. Residential mortgages and related securities are a significant portion of the bank’s balance sheet, i.e., $ 4.4 B Residential Loans and $ 1 B MBS.  The Dynamic Pricing Method (OAS/MC) is a much more robust method used to value mortgage products and calculate their market value sensitivity to rate changes. 
It is common industry practice for Risk to EVE measurement when a bank has a significant amount of residential mortgage loans and MBS on their balance sheet.  
In addition, the lattice model should be used for floating rate loans with embedded caps or floors, callable bonds, and any “stand-alone” interest rate options.",2/28/2021,
54,806,1,Model1,Owner1,MRM2,Model Governance,"The BancWare model is operated through a third-party vendor Raymond James. During the validation, MRM noted the inefficiency and transparency issues related to using third party vendor for ALM modelling.
This is evident in the difficulties in verifying if configurations reflected intent of model; in retrieving account-level cashflows for replication; in retrieving discount factor/implied forward rate for interpolated points, and the non-base yield curves. ",,High,5/31/2021,5/31/2021,Completed,Completed,N/A,MRM noted such information could be obtained from BancWare based on consultant’s experience with other clients.

55,807,1,Model1,Owner1,MRM2,Conceptual Soundness,"The current prepayment assumptions used in the model were determined based on historical averages. This is an oversimplified approach and does not incorporate key risk drivers such as loan age or coupon rate.
Prepayment assumptions are considered very important ALM model inputs and they can have a significant impact on the model output. Using an oversimplified assumption may reduce the accuracy of NII and EVE forecasting. MRM noted that the current prepayment assumption method appears to be less sophisticated compared to the methods utilized by Ameris’ peers. 
One method observed in the industry is using prepayment look up table. The lookup tables allow the user to define and select prepayment speeds based on 1 to 2 factors, including the age of the instruments and the interest rate incentive to refinance. Two examples are provided below. The prepayment rate in the tables are presented as CPR (conditional prepayment rate). 
The CPR measures prepayments as a percentage of the current outstanding loan balance. For example, in the first figure, the first CPR 15.720 means, for 15-year fixed rate mortgage loans with 3.5% coupon rate, which were issued within 3 months, 15.72% of the pool's current loan balance is likely to prepay over the next year. 
The incentive rate is set on a relative basis, which is defined as the spread between the market rate and the coupon rate. For the spread that is between two break points, CPR can be interpolated by using the closest available data points. For the spread that is out of the specified range, the smallest/largest CPR can be used as the floor/cap during the calculation. Model owner can build the prepayment lookup tables based on historical data.
Besides the lookup table, using a prepayment model developed using statistical methods to determine the projected ratio is a commonly observed practice in industry.  A prepayment model can be built internally or purchased from a third -party vendor.  There are prepayment models that can be seamlessly incorporated into the BancWare ALM model. One such example is the Andrew Davidson & Co. (ADCo) prepayment model that is widely used in the banking industry.",,High,5/31/2021,5/31/2021,Completed,Completed,N/A,"The Raymond James BancWare solution that Ameris uses does not offer the option to utilize a third-party prepayment model although the in-house version does. This limitation again supports the overall recommendation to move to an in-house BancWare model.  Ameris’ has significant mortgage exposure. Given that the current mortgage prepayment assumption method may reduce the model accuracy and is not consistent with industry practice, the model owner should refine the current method of deriving prepayment assumptions by adopting a more sophisticated method. ",2/28/2021,
56,808,1,Model1,Owner1,MRM2,Model Documentation,"Per review of the model documentation and discussion with the model owner, MRM noted that the current prepayment speed, deposit decay and rate Beta assumptions were calculated based on historical data. However, the details of the calculation are not disclosed in the model documentation or other supporting documents. For example, the time period of the data used in the assumption calculation cannot be found in any of the model documents.
The model owner did not maintain the assumption calculation files and cannot provide the underlying data to MRM for assumption replication.
In addition, although the model owner briefly discussed the rationale of these model assumptions in the model documentation, there is no study or analysis documented to support the selected method and numbers.  This is inconsistent with industry practice.
Prepayment speed, Deposit decay and Beta assumptions are critical inputs for BancWare ALM model and should be supported and maintained carefully. Not keeping the assumption calculation files and lack of supporting study/analysis may introduce risk to the appropriateness of key assumptions and influence the accuracy of the model output.

58,810,1,Model1,Owner1,MRM2,Conceptual Soundness,"MRM noted that Deposit Decay rates are assumed to be static and the same rates are used in all scenarios. Different decay behaviour is usually observed in accounts with different size, vintage and type (i.e. personal or business). Personal deposit account’s decay is sensitive to the interest rate environment.  In general, higher market rates lead to a faster decay rate and lower market rates lead to a slower decay rate.  Using same deposit decay rates under all scenarios may decrease the accuracy of the model projection.  ",,Medium,11/30/2021,11/30/2021,Completed,Completed,N/A,MRM recommends that model owner incorporate deposit decay’s interest rate sensitivity either through modeling or qualitative factors. ,2/28/2021,
59,811,1,Model1,Owner1,MRM2,Conceptual Soundness,"MRM noted that all the key rates are held flat over the NII 24-month forecasting period. Keeping key rates constant is an oversimplified assumption compared to the other approaches observed in the industry. It also eliminates the adjusted rate feature of the variable rate instruments (e.g. ARM) and introduces inaccuracy to the model projection. There are several methods to determine the key rate projections over the forecasting period.
•	Obtain forward rates from external vendors
Some vendors like Blue Chip publishes monthly forward rates/curves for important indices such as 3-month Libor. Model owner can upload those numbers as the most likely scenario to replace the current flat rate scenario.
•	Generate forward rates from discount curves and other basis curves
The Libor Swap curve and other standard curves can be easily obtained from a lot of data sources. For all the key indices with different tenors, the next 12 months implied forward rates can be derived from the corresponding curves directly. For example, 3-month Libor can be derived from Libor Swap curve; 1-Month Libor can be derived from 1-month Libor basis swap curve.",,Low,11/30/2021,11/30/2021,Completed,Completed,N/A,MRM recommended that model owner document the limitation of the current methodology and replace the current flat key rate method with a more realistic variable forward rate method when the model is brought in-house.,2/28/2021,

MRM discovered that certain term points of the Treasury rates (CMT) in BancWare did not match the rates from the data source for the Dec 2020 model.
